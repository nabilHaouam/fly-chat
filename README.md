# fly-chat
This is a simple chat app made with react/nodejs/express/socket. It has basic features such as instant messaging, fetching active users, notifying users when someone is typing ...
It is not linked to a database right now although it's a good idea to link it to a mongodb later so it becomes a full on MERN app.
another idea to consider is to add push notifications to it to make it cooler .
design is still crappy :)
