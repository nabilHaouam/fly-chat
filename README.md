# fly-chat
This is a simple chat app made with react/nodejs/express/socket. It has basic features such as instant messaging, fetching active users, notifying users when someone is typing ...

THIS APP CURRENTLY USES BROWSERS LOCAL STORAGE TO STORE THE USERNAME(BECAUSE IT'S NOT LINKED TO A DATA BASE), THEREFORE, TO SEE THE MESSAGES COMING AND GOING, YOU MUSE OPEN 2 INSTANCES OF THE APP IN TWO DIFFERENT BROWSERS. IF YOU OPEN TWO INSTANCES IN TWO TABS OF THE SAME BROWSERS , YOU WON'T HAVE MESSAGES COMING BECAUSE THE LOCAL STORAGE IS THE SAME.

It is not linked to a database right now although it's a good idea to link it to a mongodb later so it becomes a full on MERN app.
another idea to consider is to add push notifications to it to make it cooler .
design is still crappy :)
